# text2video-finetune

Colab-friendly template to **fine-tune a text-to-video diffusion model**, upload it to **Hugging Face (private)**, and ship a **Gradio Space** demo (which you can later make paid).

> Note: End-to-end full fine-tuning for large text-to-video models is compute-heavy. This template gives you a **working scaffold** you can run on Colab (T4/A100). It includes a **lightweight "LoRA-style" scaffold** section to show *where* your training logic goes. Adapt it to your data & hardware.

## Quick Start (Colab)

1. Open the notebook:
   - `text2video-finetune.ipynb` (click **Open in Colab** button inside the notebook if viewing on GitHub)
2. Run cells top-to-bottom:
   - Install libs
   - Login to Hugging Face
   - Load your dataset (zip upload or HF dataset)
   - Load pretrained pipeline
   - (Optional) Run lightweight training scaffold
   - Save & upload model to your **private** repo on Hugging Face
3. Create a Space and drop `space_app/app.py` there (or copy the code into a new Space).
4. In Space settings, enable **Paid Space** when you're ready to sell (Stripe required).

## Files

- `text2video-finetune.ipynb` — main Colab notebook.
- `space_app/app.py` — minimal Gradio UI for your model.
- `requirements.txt` — Python deps for local runs / Space build logs.

## Tips

- Keep videos short (2–5s) and consistent resolution for training.
- Start small (few steps) to validate pipeline; then scale.
- Add example prompts & outputs to your **model card (README on HF)**.
- Make the model **private** if you plan to sell access.
